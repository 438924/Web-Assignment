                <p>
                    Here at hot Beans Web, we offer many different jobs under the umbrella of Web Development.
                    These include: Front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack development. 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Front-end Developer
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A Front-end developer is someone who deals with the development of the graphical user
                    interface of the website. They use languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve this.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Back-end Developer
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A Back-end developer is someone who is an expert in building and maintaining mechanisms which 
                    process data and perform actions on a website. The difference between a Front-end developer and
                    a back-end developer is that back-end developers are involved in data storage, security, and other 
                    side functions which are not seen.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Full-stack Developer
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A full-stack developer is someone who can develop both client and server software. This means 
                    that a person with this role will need to be experienced in both HTML and CSS. In addition to
                    this, they will also need to know how to: program a browser (using JavaScript, jQuery, 
                    Angular, or Vue), program a server (using PHP, ASP, Python, or Node), and program a database
                    (using SQL, SQLite, or MongoDB). 
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Our Trainees Program
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In addition to these job positions, we also have a trainees program. This program is what we
                    consider to be our most essential feature. Young and aspiring web developers can come to us and
                    be given a chance to show what they are capable of. They will gain experience of not only 
                    being a web developer, but being in the environment of a web developer studio.
