                    We are a web development company that focusses on giving young web developers a chance to demonstrate what they are capable of and become the best web 
                    developers they can be. We offer excellent courses for young developers, which anyone can access; whether employed by the company or not. Our trainees program 
                    enables people who do not have a great amount of expertise in this specific field to begin their journey as a web developer.

                    Our company was founded back in 1998, where we started off as a small company which was focussed on creating websites for those who wished for us to. So, in 
                    essence, the general purpose of our company hasn't changed. As we continued to grow, we took on more employees and our purpose began to change. We decided to move
                    into becoming a company which offered courses and a trainee program which helped young developers be the best they can be.
